<h1>Employee Tracker</h1>

Employee Tracker is a CRUD application built in C++ that allows you to create a company and keep track of employees.

You start off by creating your company, by passing in the name.

Then you can add, edit and delete the employees.

You can then save this out to a CSV file (stored in %APPDATA%) and then read that back in, next time the application loads.

Created to showcase my C++ and rebuild that skill set.
- Started off as a console application
- Stretch goal is to make a GUI application. Most likely with QT.
